# TTTsandbox
I made this project to strip down and start from scratch on my other tic tac toe code, mainly to get the drag and drop function working.  Things kept going well, so now this code is look and acting almost as well as the other code.  I was especially pleased that I now have the information about what piece type was dropped, and what slot it was dropped on.  This critical information is not ready to be sent to the server in an API call.
